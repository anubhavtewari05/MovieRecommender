## Dataset

The TMDB dataset, short for "The Movie Database" dataset, is a comprehensive collection of movie-related data provided by The Movie Database (TMDB). This dataset contains a wide range of information about movies, including details about the movie itself, such as title, release date, runtime, genres, cast and crew information, budget, revenue, and much more.

The TMDB dataset is widely used by researchers, developers, and enthusiasts for various purposes, including movie recommendation systems, analysis of movie trends, building movie-related applications, and more. It's available in structured formats such as CSV files or through APIs provided by TMDB for direct access to their database.
